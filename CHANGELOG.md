## [R4.10] — 2026-08-05

### Fixed — Remove hardcoded localhost fallback origin (R4.10)

- `source/lib/AppContext.brs`: `GetServerUrl()` no longer falls back to `http://localhost:8096`. Returns "" when no server is configured — callers must check `IsServerConnected()` first and route to Connect.
- `scripts/verify-runtime.sh`: Added CHECK 15 to detect hardcoded localhost URLs in source files.
